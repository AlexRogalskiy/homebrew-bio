# Linuxbrew Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics formulae for the Linuxbrew and Homebrew package managers.

## How do I install a formula?

```
brew install linuxbrew/bioinformatics/FORMULA
```

Or `brew tap linuxbrew/bioinformatics` and then `brew install FORMULA`, where `FORMULA` is the name of the formula that you would like to install.

## Troubleshooting

First read the [Troubleshooting Checklist](http://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting.html).

Use `brew gist-logs <formula>` to create a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and post the link in your issue.

Search the [issues](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/homebrew-bioinformatics/issues?q=). See also Linuxbrew's [Common Issues](http://docs.brew.sh/Common-Issues.html) and [FAQ](http://docs.brew.sh/FAQ.html).

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Linuxbrew's documentation](https://github.com/Linuxbrew/brew/blob/master/docs/README.md).
